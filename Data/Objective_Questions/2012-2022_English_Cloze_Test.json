But other  \nways,  like talking  to someone  you trust,  can lead you to solving  your problem  or at \nleast feeling  better.  \nTry taking  these  four steps.  the next time you are stressed:  \n(1) Get support.  When  you need  help,  reach  out to the people  who care about  \nyou. Talk to a trusted  adult,  such as a parent  or other  relatives.    72    They  might  \nhave  had similar  problems,  such as dealing  with a test, or the death  of a beloved  pet. \n(2) Don’t take it out on yourself.  Sometimes  when  kids are stressed  and upset  \nthey take it out on themselves.  Oh, dear,  that’s not a good  idea.  Remember  that there  \n  are always  people  to help you. Don’t take it out on yourself.    73    \n(3) Try to solve  the problem.  After  you’re calm  and you have  support  from  \nadults  and friends,  it’s time to get down  to business.    74    Even  if you can’t solve  \nit all, you can solve  a piece  of it. \n(4) Be positive.  Most  stress  is temporary  (暂时的 ). Remember  stress  does go \naway,  especially  when  you figure  out the problem  and start working  on solving  it.  \nThese  steps  aren’t magic,  but they do work.  And if you can stay positive  as you \nyou’re  your way through  a tough  time,  you’ll help yourself  feel better  even  faster.    \n75    \nA. Ask for a helping  hand  to get you through  the tough  situation.  \nB. Notice  your friends ’ feelings  and find a way to help them.  \nC. Different  people  feel stress  in different  ways.  \nD. Ah, it feels  so good  when  the stress  is gone.  \nE. You need  to figure  out what  the problem  is. \nF. And don’t forget  about  your friends.  \nG. Then,  find a way to calm  down.\n",

Banks,  companies,  and government  \nagencies  use secret  codes  in doing  business,  especially  when  information  is sent by \ncomputer.  \nPeople  have  used secret  codes  for thousands  of years.     36    Code  breaking  \nnever  lags (落后 ) far behind  code  making.  The science  of creating  and reading  coded  \nmessages  is called  cryptography.  \nThere  are three  main  types  of cryptography.     37    For example,  the first \nletters  of “My elephant  eats too many  eels”  spell out the hidden  message  “Meet  me.”  \n   38    You might  represent  each letter  with a number,  for example.  Let’s  \nnumber  the letters  of the alphabet,  in order,  from  1 to 26. If we substitute  a number  for \neach letter,  the message  “Meet  me” would  read “13 5 5 20 13 5.” \nA code  uses symbols  to replace  words,  phrases,  or sentences.  To read the \nmessage  of a real code,  you must  have  a code  book.     39    For example,  \n“bridge”  might  stand  for “meet”  and “out”  might  stand  for “me.”  The message  \n  “Bridge  out” would  actually  mean  “Meet  me.”     40    However,  it is also hard to \nkeep  a code  book  secret  for long.

Know that your life is your own; you are the only one in this world.(你是否希望最终你会因为自己的生活比他们的好而感到有力量？要知道，你的生活是你自己的；你在这个世界上是独一无二的。)可知，本段主要讲述不要把自己和别人作比较，因为生活是我们自己的，我们也是世界上独一无二的。故F. Stop comparing yourself with others.(停止把自己和别人进行比较。)可以作为本段中心句，故选F项。\n【38题详解】\n根据本文的中心句Forgive yourself for mistakes that you have made. (原谅自己所犯的错误。)及下文的You will make mistakes, time and time again. (你会一次又一次地犯错误。)可知，本句是在说明要讲自己看作一个普通人，普通人是会犯错的。选项D. Remember, you are only human.(记住，你只是个人。)与上下文衔接最好，故选D项。\n【39题详解】\n根据上文List all of your accomplishments and achievements. You have a job, earned your degree, and you got out of bed today.(列出你所有的成就。你有了一份工作，拿到了学位，今天你拜托了困境。)可知，这些小事都是你取得的成就，都值得庆祝，即没有什么事是太小而不值得庆祝的。故选C项。\n【40题详解】\n结合上文Put into words why you feel unworthy, why you don't feel good enough. Now, read these words back to yourself.(用语言来解释为什么你觉得自己不值得，为什么你觉得自己不够好。现在，自己读一下这些话。)和下文的Turn to a page in your journal to your list of strengths and achievements. See how awesome you are? (翻到你日记本上记下你的优点和成就的那页。看到你有多棒了吗？)可推知本句是在说明“再次感到心烦意乱”的情况。选项A. Feeling upset again?(再次感觉心烦意乱了吗？)最合上下文语境，故选A项。\n",

            "analysis": "【解析】\n【导语】本文是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了一些外出就餐时要知道的一些重要事情。\n【16题详解】\n根据文章标题“Important Things to Know When Dining Out (外出就餐时要知道的重要事情)”可知，本文主要介绍的是外出就餐时应该知道的重要事情。由此可知，D项“Don’t get caught making an embarrassing mistake at a restaurant (不要在餐馆犯尴尬的错误)”符合语境，其中“at a restaurant”对应标题中的“When Dining Out”，同时引起下文“Knowing some tips will help ensure that you have an enjoyable meal with friends or family — no matter where you are in the world. (知道一些技巧将有助于确保你和朋友或家人一起享受一顿愉快的晚餐——无论你在世界的哪个地方)”。故选D。\n【17题详解】\n根据本段小标题“Chopstick Rules”可知，本段主要讲述的是使用筷子的规则。根据上文“When you put them down between bites, always put them down together so they are parallel with the edge of the table in front of you. (当你在吃的间隙把它们放下来的时候，一定要把它们放在一起，这样它们就和你面前的桌子边缘平行了)”可知，此处讲述了正确使用筷子的方式。由此可知，F项“Never stick them upright in your food or cross them as you use them (不要把它们笔直地插在你的食物中，也不要在使用它们时交叉放置)”讲述的也是使用筷子时的注意事项，符合此处语境，其中“them”指的是上文的“chopsticks”。故选F。\n【18题详解】\n根据本段小标题“Hands or Utensils (餐具)”可知，本段主要讲述的是手和餐具的问题。根据上文“In India and the Middle East, it’s considered very rude to eat with your left hand. People in France expect you to eat with a utensil in each hand. (在印度和中东，用左手吃饭被认为是非常不礼貌的。法国人希望你每只手拿一个餐具吃饭)”及下文“instead preferring to use their hands (相反更愿意使用他们的双手)”可知，此处在讲述不同国家就餐时习惯使用哪只手的问题。由此可知，C项“Mexicans consider it inappropriate to eat with utensils (墨西哥人认为用餐具吃饭是不合适的)”符合语境，与下文形成转折关系。故选C。\n【19题详解】\n根据本段小标题“Making Requests”可知，本段主要讲述的是用餐时提请求的问题。根据下文“In Portugal, this would be a serious mistake, because it shows the chef that you don’t like their seasoning skills. Similarly, in Italy, never ask for extra cheese to add to your food. (在葡萄牙，这将是一个严重的错误，因为这向厨师表明你不喜欢他们的调味技巧。同样，在意大利，永远不要要求在食物中添加额外的奶酪)”可推知，在一些国家，用餐时提出要求是很无礼的。由此可知，G项“It may seem like simple request to ask for salt and pepper at a meal (吃饭时要盐和胡椒看似很简单)”符合此处语境，其中“request”是关键词，说明，在用餐时提出一些我们看来很平常的要求在某些国家是无礼的。故选G。\n【20题详解】\n根据下文“the more comfortable you’ll begin to feel with its foreign cultural practices. (你就会对它的外国文化习俗感到越舒服)”可推知，此处指在一个国家待得越久，就会越习惯当地习俗，且此处是“the+比较级，the+比较级”结构，B项“The more time you spend in any given country (你在某个国家待的时间越长)”符合文意，引出下文。故选B。\n",
